This project includes a jar file, that works are a runnable jar in command line.
This allows the user to decide if they would like to would like to enter values to populate the world with on their own or if they would like to just go with the default amounts for each of the different types.
It also gives the user the option for how many days they would like the simulation to run for.
Then the simulation runs, on each day the animals will move around from square to sqaure and then they may eat or be eaten, and then if they do not eat the amount of days they have left until they need to eat will be deincremented.
The simulation each day will print out the number of animals that have been eaten, where they were when it happened and who did it.
It will also print out the animals that died of starvation and their location. 
It will give the user the option to print out the rest of the living plants and animals or not, this will occur each day. 
It will also print out the number of which day in the simulation it is as well as the number of plants and the number of animals that are left alive in the world.
Eventually the only thing left will be plants because they do not die but the animals do.
